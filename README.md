 <p align="center">Incentivized feedback & task completion platform.</p>
</p>

**Earnbase** is a decentralized platform where users complete tasks, submit feedback, and earn on-chain rewards. It uses AI to evaluate the helpfulness and quality of each user's feedback, awarding bonus rewards based on value â€” not just participation.

Originally created to support the beta testing of the ChamaPay miniapp, EarnBase aims to evolve into a general-purpose tool for engaging testers, collecting actionable insights, and distributing rewards on Celo.
