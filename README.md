 <p align="center">Incentivized feedback & task completion platform.</p>
</p>

**Earnbase** is a decentralized platform where users complete tasks, submit feedback, and earn on-chain rewards. It uses AI to evaluate the helpfulness and quality of each user's feedback, awarding bonus rewards based on value â€” not just participation.

Originally created to support the beta testing of the ChamaPay miniapp, EarnBase aims to evolve into a general-purpose tool for engaging users, collecting actionable insights, and distributing rewards on Celo.

## Problem Statement

Across Web3 and beyond, quality feedback and contributions are essential for progress â€” yet theyâ€™re often unstructured, overlooked, or under-rewarded. Whether it's for improving digital products, conducting research, or gathering community insights, getting meaningful input is difficult, and contributors rarely feel their voices truly matter.
Key challenges:

 - How do we fairly recognize and reward people for thoughtful input?
 - Can we create fun, engaging, and transparent feedback loops?
 - How can teams or researchers avoid sorting through low-effort or spammy submissions?
EarnBase was built to solve these â€” not just for developers, but for anyone seeking high-quality, incentivized feedback.

## Solution

EarnBase solves this by creating a gamified, AI-assisted feedback loop:
- **Task Assignment** â€” Users find purposeful tasks (testing, reviews, surveys, etc.).
- **Feedback Submission** â€” Users complete the tasks and submit written feedback or results.
- **AI Evaluation** â€” Feedback is scored using AI models that assess clarity, helpfulness, and depth.
- **Reward Distribution** â€” Every participant earns a base reward. High-quality feedback earns bonus rewards calculated based on AI scores.
- **Leaderboard & Rankings** â€” Users compete for top spots on the leaderboard, driving friendly competition and continuous engagement.

## Objectives

- Create a structured environment for crowdsourced task execution.
- Reward contributors based on effort and value, not just participation.
- Enable projects to collect high-quality, AI-filtered user insights at scale.

- **ðŸ›  Public Task Creation** - Earnbase is now open to public. Anyone can now:
    - Create tasks
    - Define specific expectations and requirements (which will help guide the AI evaluation)
